Then you’ll dive into back-end development with Node.js and MongoDB by creating a to-do list application that can actually be deployed. After that, you’ll learn why single page applications have become so popular over the years, as we create a voting system application that utilizes jQuery’s AJAX functionality to create one. 
Cover your projects in Unit Tests, this is why you are go ing to separately take a look at utilizing Mocha to unit test our voting system application. Then, we’ll then take a look at Bootstrap, the most popular HTML framework, while creating an exam application that will look amazing. In the last unit, you’ll explore the basics of Docker and deploy our to-do list application to a Docker container.
